# Environmental covariates and random effects

.pull-left-60[
## Controversial opinion: 

Fitting the assessment model isn't our ultimate goal!  
Catch advice for future years is. 

Random effects often improve model fit and solve model diagnostic problems, but may mask signals that could be explained by and projected with mechanistic processes.

## Atlantic herring, *Clupea harengus*

???
Both random effects and environmental covariates can help explain modeled population dynamics, but they may interact in unexpected ways. 

RE represent cumulative unknown drivers, which can be difficult to project into the future without understanding mechanisms, while environmental covariates represent possibly predictable but incomplete mechanistic drivers, whose influence may change over time.

RE solve a lot of diagnostic issues in models (e.g. retrospective patterns) and are considerably easier to implement than environmental covariates, which often require investment in research and development.


Considerable effort has been invested in evaluating potential environmental drivers of stock productivity, mortality, and/or availability in recent Northwest Atlantic stock assessments. Additional recent investment in regional ocean modeling is aimed at operational short term prediction of environmental conditions such as bottom temperature. Environmental drivers have been successfully included in stock assessments using the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM), a state-space modeling framework. Here we review lessons learned and controversial opinions generated from attempts to include environmental recruitment covariates within a stock assessment for Atlantic herring. Environmental covariates were tailored to herring life history and implemented based on mechanistic hypotheses. Despite significant correlations with recruitment estimated from a prior (non-state-space) assessment model, none of the covariates were included in the final state-space model. We draw two main conclusions. First, even in a state of the art model there are limits on environmental covariate inclusion. For example, mechanistic linkages available for recruitment covariates dwindle if a stock recruit relationship cannot be estimated. Second, tradeoffs may exist between including mechanistic drivers as covariates and including random effects that account for variation from unidentified mechanisms. Herring recruitment covariates had much stronger explanatory power in the absence of numbers at age (NAA) random effects, but model fit was much better with NAA random effects. Given that some environmental covariates can be forecast, while some random effects cannot or it is not clear how, this presents a dilemma. Do we risk sacrificing short term prediction capability (needed by management) for assessment model fit (needed to get models accepted for use in management)?

# A new and improved herring assessment, but no luck with the covariate. Why?

State space assessment has much better diagnostics, stability

WHAM assessment framework designed to incorporate environmental covariates 

Haddock predation had negligible impact on recruitment

Why?

Limited ways to implement covariates: no stock recruit relationship

Best fit with numbers at age transition random effects: correlations among ages but not years 

???
New state space model developed with NAA RE, best fit with numbers at age transition correlations among ages but not years

Image of NAA RE pattern

Good model diagnostics

Including the covariate in the model: only one approach possible because stock recruit relationship not estimable

Model estimates recruitment as annual iid RE around an estimated fixed effect recruitment scaling parameter ("mean-ish" recruitment)

Model estimates a fit to covariate data, then estimates parameters of relationship with recruitment scaling parameter (lag-1-linear)

Image of fit to haddock predation index covariate


---
# Covariate impacts stronger, but overall fit poorer without NAA RE

An experiment fitting the model without NAA RE on older ages and with the environmental covariate resulted in poorer model fit but a much stronger covariate effect

And a different recruitment time series? NAA RE on ages soaking up some uncertainty that could be explained mechanistically

Image comparing recruitment deviations with and without NAA RE and impact of haddock predation index 

Need methods to address multiple covariates: larval optimal temperature duration similar results to haddock predation

# Discussion

Do we risk sacrificing short term prediction capability (needed by management) for assessment model fit (needed to get models accepted for use in management)? 

RE interactions with covariates in state space assessment models obviously needs more investigation

We tend to obsess about historical model fit, then do projections separately with a single best fit model, but projections are the thing used in management for catch advice

Past performance does not guarantee future returns!

## Overview of results shown for each model

.pull-left[
Summary table comparing across models with and without recruitment covariates turned on

Diagnostics shown: 

*  WHAM's fit to the covariate time series
*  One step ahead residuals for WHAM's fit
*  Estimated time varying recruitment scaling parameter with N age 1

Finally, recruitment sigma compared with base, covariate beta with CI

] 

.pull-right[

The main diagnostics we used to determine if the model was improved by covariates were:

*  model converged and Hessian matrix invertable
*  dAIC lowest
*  recruitment sigma reduced (how much?)
*  estimated covariate effect CI does not include 0
*  direction of covariate effect is sensible
